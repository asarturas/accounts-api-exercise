## Accounts Api

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money
transfers between accounts.

### Explicit requirements

1. keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is invoked by another internal system/service)
2. use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the requirement #1
3. the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
4. the final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed container/server)
5. demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected
